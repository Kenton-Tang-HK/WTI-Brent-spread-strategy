# WTI-Brent-spread-strategy

## Overview
This project focuses on developing and testing predictive models using the Random Forest Classifier to generate buy, sell, or hold signals for WTI crude oil. It leverages daily returns of Natural Gas and EURUSD, alongside the WTI-Brent spread, to predict market movements. Employing a combination of NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization, and sklearn for model implementation, this project aims at outperforming the traditional buy-and-hold strategy through rigorous back-testing.

## Features
- **Model Development**: Utilizes the Random Forest Classifier from sklearn to predict buy, sell, or hold signals.
- **Data Sources**: Analyzes daily returns of Natural Gas and EURUSD, and the WTI-Brent spread.
- **Back-Testing**: Conducts a comprehensive back-test against the traditional buy-and-hold strategy to validate the model's performance.

## Requirements
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- sklearn

## Installation
To set up the project environment, ensure you have Python installed on your system, then run the following commands: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
